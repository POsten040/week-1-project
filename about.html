          <li>Born in Tampa Fl, learned to sail at a young age.</li>
          <li>Quickly found a love of music in school, studied classical guitar.</li>
          <li>Studied the comedic arts in the skreets.</li>
          <li>Went to the University of South Florida for visual art, slept more than he studied, studied more than he partied, and partied as often as possible.</li>
          <li>Worked in restaurants, online auction companies, department stores, and sold t-shirts at market.</li>
          <li>Settled into a job as a photographer, learned to open up to people quickly and make them laugh.</li>
          <li>Lived in Orlando, ate lots of ramen(the good kind), but never went to Disney and will most likely never go.</li>
          <li>Found a better job working at the university there for the office of Accessability. Worked with students with disabilities on campus and grew much in the process.</li>
          <li>Left that job during the summer of 2020(which will not be named), to pursue a more sustainable career.</li>
          <li>Moved to Portland to learn coding, eat more ramen, and make dreams come true.</li>
